## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
For this project, I used what I learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify (i.e., identify) ZE GERMAN classify traffic signs.  The dataset is based off of the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset), but has already been preprocessed by our friends at Udacity into neat Protobuf files for easy usage. 

Since my model is now fully trained and ready-to-run, you can see the results of it based on some German traffic signs that I find on the web.


To meet the specifications of this project, I have submitted just one file.  It is my IPython notebook, in all three forms of ipynb, pdf, and html form.  The IPython notebook contains my writeup, since I felt that was a nicer way to organize where my writing goes, and to self-document the outline of the architecture, which should hopefully be readable in the code itself.  I believe I have met all the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view).
1. [the Ipython notebook with the code](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). 
2. [the code exported as an html file](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
3. [a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file (it can be either 1 or 2)](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.pdf)
